description: Group related atoms into a wiki page. Use when the user runs /atomic-wiki:compile, or when enough new atoms have accumulated in a branch to warrant compiling them.

# Compile

Take a set of related atoms from `atoms/<branch>/` and produce a wiki page at `wiki/<branch>/<topic-slug>.md` that synthesizes them as coherent prose.

## When to use

- User runs `/atomic-wiki:compile <branch>` or `/atomic-wiki:compile <branch> <slug>`.
- A branch has accumulated 3–8 new atoms on a coherent subtopic.
- An existing wiki page needs to be rebuilt because one of its source atoms changed (look at the footer `*Compiled from atoms: ...*` line).

## Procedure

1. **Pick the scope.** Either the user specifies the slug(s), or you propose a grouping: "these 5 atoms cluster around X, want me to compile them into `wiki/<branch>/<slug>.md`?"
2. **Confirm slug naming.** Filename pattern: `wiki/<branch>/<topic-slug>.md`, all lowercase, hyphens only. The folder carries the branch name — **do not repeat the branch in the slug** (`wiki/mcp/auth.md`, not `wiki/mcp/mcp-auth.md`).
3. **Synthesize.** Don't dump atoms one per section. Group by what a reader wants to understand. Write coherent prose. Preserve the original voice — wiki is opinionated knowledge, not encyclopedia.
4. **Cross-reference.** First mention of a related concept links to its page: `[[branch/slug]]`. The path must equal an existing wiki page (relative to `wiki/`, no `.md`). Subsequent mentions in the same page don't repeat the link.
5. **Carry image embeds.** When a source atom anchors its claim with an embedded image, carry the `![...](../../raw/...)` embed into the page next to the prose that uses it. Wiki pages sit at the same depth as atoms, so the path works verbatim. Don't repeat an image already embedded earlier on the same page.
6. **Use temporal markers correctly.** Specific dates (`as of 2026-04`) or version numbers (`v3.5`). Avoid bare `currently` / `latest` / `now` in time-sensitive contexts.
7. **Footer source list.** End with `*Compiled from atoms: branch/atom-a, branch/atom-b, ...*` so the page is traceable.

## Wiki page structure

```markdown
# Page Title

Opening paragraph: why this matters, common misconception, what the reader will get.

## Section
Integrated content from multiple atoms, coherent prose. First mention of a
related concept gets a [[branch/wiki-link]].

## Section
Continue.

## Length

- Target 1500–2500 words per page.
- Past 2500 words: consider splitting.
- Below 800 words: consider merging or staying at atom level.

## Parallel compile: slug-lock procedure

When compiling multiple pages in parallel (multiple agents or one agent across multiple branches):

1. **A coordinator pre-locks the slug list per branch first.** This is a flat list, e.g., `mcp/auth`, `mcp/transport`, `mcp/tools`.
2. **Each agent is assigned slugs to fill.** Agents never name files.
3. **Each agent writes only into its assigned slugs.**

Without a slug lock, parallel agents will invent different filenames for overlapping content (`mcp-plus-skills.md` vs `mcp-plus-skills-architecture.md`).

## Constraints

- Group by topic, not one atom per page. Typical wiki page = 3–8 atoms.
- Filename `wiki/<branch>/<topic-slug>.md`, all lowercase, hyphens only, no branch prefix in the slug.
- First line must be `# title`.
- Use `[[branch/slug]]` for cross-references. The path inside `[[ ]]` must equal an existing wiki page.
- Image embeds keep the `../../raw/...` paths from their atoms; lint flags embeds whose file is missing.
- Footer lists source atoms by id.

## After compile

After writing or updating wiki pages, run:

```bash
bash "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/gen-index.sh"
```

This regenerates `index.md` (belt-and-suspenders — the **atomic-wiki plugin** also ships a `PostToolUse` hook that rebuilds `index.md` when you write a `wiki/` file, and a `Stop` hook that runs the lint). Commit when ready.

If a wiki page is wrong because the underlying atom is wrong, fix the atom and recompile — never patch the wiki directly. The atom is truth; the wiki is a derived cache.

See `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/reference/SCHEMA.md` and `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/METHODOLOGY.md` (Phase 6) for the full reasoning.
