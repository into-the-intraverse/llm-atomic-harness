# Atomic Wiki — Schema for LLMs operating a wiki

Formal spec — read it before touching anything. Mental model, file formats, lifecycle rules, what you must never do. The reasoning behind each choice lives in [METHODOLOGY.md](../METHODOLOGY.md).

---

## Mental model

Three storage layers and one navigation layer. History is in git — there is no separate log file.

```
raw/                  sources you may read but never write
atoms/                knowledge atoms, organized by topic-branch
  <branch-1>/         one folder per topic
  <branch-2>/         each contains atoms (source of truth)
wiki/                 compiled pages, mirrors the atom branch tree
  <branch-1>/
  <branch-2>/
index.md              auto-generated wiki navigation
```

Atoms are mutable but versioned: edit the atom in place, bump the integer in `version:` when the body changed beyond formatting. Git is the audit trail — `git log atoms/<branch>/<file>.md` shows every prior version. The pre-commit hook (installed by `/atomic-wiki:init`, running the vendored `.wiki/check-version-bump.sh`) refuses commits where an atom's body changed without a version bump.

Wiki is rebuildable from atoms. If a wiki page is wrong, fix the underlying atom and recompile, never patch the wiki.

## Atom format (spec)

### Frontmatter (YAML, required)

```yaml
---
id: <branch>/<descriptive-slug>
type: explanation | opinion | tutorial | myth-busting | case-study | comparison
depth: beginner | intermediate | advanced
source_type: post | reply | thread | transcript | article | note | screenshot | audio | video
source_ids: []
reuse_score: high | medium | low
tags: []
version: 1
---
```

| Field | Notes |
|-------|-------|
| `id` | Format `<branch>/<slug>`. Slug all lowercase, hyphens only. Must be unique within branch. |
| `type` | What kind of knowledge this atom carries. Pick one. |
| `depth` | Audience level. Used in gap analysis. |
| `source_type` | Where the raw came from. Extend the enum if your sources differ. |
| `source_ids` | Stable identifiers (URLs, paths, post IDs). Atoms without source attribution are not auditable. |
| `reuse_score` | `high` = standalone-publishable, `medium` = needs companions, `low` = niche. |
| `tags` | Cross-cutting concerns. Used to surface related atoms across branches. |
| `version` | Integer, starts at `1`. Bump by 1 every time the body changes beyond pure whitespace. The pre-commit hook enforces this. |

Optional fields you may add: `confidence` (high/medium/low).

Dates are deliberately **not** in frontmatter. Git tracks creation (`git log --diff-filter=A --follow -- <file>`) and last-modified (`git log -1`). Obsidian Dataview can query `file.ctime` / `file.mtime` directly.

### Filename

Pattern: `<descriptive-slug>.md`

- Slug all lowercase, hyphens only — no underscores, no spaces, no uppercase.
- Slug should be 3–6 words describing the core claim.
- No date prefix — git owns that.

### Body

- One core claim per atom. If two independent claims share a paragraph, split into two atoms.
- The first line states the claim. Everything after it earns its place — mechanism, evidence,
  numbers, caveats, an example, the opposing case. A body that re-announces the claim before
  adding anything is deleted; if that leaves no body, the first line is the atom. A one-paragraph
  atom is a finished atom.
- Refine, don't copy. Strip filler from the source; preserve the author's voice and stance.
- An image that anchors the claim (chart, diagram, slide, code screenshot) is embedded in the
  body with standard markdown: `![alt](../../raw/<path>)`. Reference `raw/` — never copy the
  file into `atoms/`. "Read-only" forbids writing into `raw/`, not linking to it.
- Cite source at the end if you want traceability beyond `source_ids`. The quote must carry what
  `source_ids` cannot — a memorable phrasing, an attribution, a figure. A quote that paraphrases
  the first line is a third copy of the claim.
- One claim, one atom, however many sources. A new source that makes a claim the wiki already
  holds is appended to that atom's `source_ids` (bump `version`), not written as a twin. A source
  that *contradicts* an existing atom gets its own atom — a contradiction is two claims — with
  each body naming the other's `id` and both sharing a tag.

### Lifecycle (mutable, versioned)

When knowledge evolves (view changes, technology updates, better wording):

1. Edit the atom file in place — do not create a new atom.
2. Bump `version:` by 1.
3. Commit. Git keeps the prior text in history; `git log -p atoms/<branch>/<file>.md` retrieves it.
4. Recompile any wiki page that referenced the atom.

The pre-commit hook (installed by `/atomic-wiki:init`, vendored to `.wiki/check-version-bump.sh`) compares the staged file against `HEAD` ignoring whitespace and blank lines. If anything substantive changed, the hook requires `version:` to be strictly greater than the previous value. New atoms must declare `version: 1`.

Pure formatting commits (whitespace cleanup, blank-line normalization) pass without a bump.

You do not need an `_archive/` folder and you do not need a `superseded_by` field — git is the archive.

See `templates/atom.md` for a copyable starter.

## Wiki page format (spec)

### Filename

Pattern: `wiki/<branch>/<topic-slug>.md`

- One subfolder per branch, mirroring the atom tree. `gen-index.sh` walks subfolders to group pages.
- Slug all lowercase, hyphens only. Do **not** repeat the branch name in the slug — the folder already carries that signal.
- The slug must be unique within its branch.

### First line

Must be `# Title`. `gen-index.sh` reads this for the index entry. Lint flags violations.

### Wiki links

Pattern: `[[<branch>/<slug>]]` or `[[<branch>/<slug>|display text]]`

- The path inside `[[ ]]` must equal an existing wiki page (relative to `wiki/`, without `.md`).
- Always include the branch — there is no short form. Lint flags ghost links and orphan pages.

### Image embeds

Standard markdown images only: `![alt](../../raw/<path>)`. Atoms and wiki pages sit at the same
depth (two levels below the repo root), so an embed copied from an atom works verbatim in the
page. Lint flags embeds whose target file does not exist. Do not use `![[ ]]` embeds — they
don't render outside Obsidian.

### Body structure

```markdown
# Page Title

Opening paragraph: why this matters, common misconception, what you'll get.

## Section
Integrated content from multiple atoms, written as coherent prose.
First mention of a related concept gets a [[branch/wiki-link]]; subsequent
mentions in the same page don't repeat it.

## Section
Continue.

- [[other-branch/related-page]] — one-line description

---
*Compiled from atoms: branch/atom-slug-1, branch/atom-slug-2, ...*
```

### Length

- Target 1500–2500 words per page.
- Past 2500 words: consider splitting.
- Below 800 words: consider merging or staying at atom level.

### Temporal markers

In time-sensitive claims, use one of:
- Specific date: `as of 2026-04`
- Version number: `v3.5`

Avoid bare `currently` / `latest` / `now` in time-sensitive contexts. Lint regex flags only `<temporal word> <version/date>` combinations to avoid false-positive flooding from rhetorical use.

See `templates/wiki-page.md` for a copyable starter.

## Branch design (spec)

### When to add a branch (all four required)

1. **Independence** — the topic doesn't fit cleanly under any existing branch.
2. **Scale** — you expect 5+ atoms in this branch.
3. **Clear boundary** — you can write a one-paragraph rule for "what belongs, what doesn't".
4. **Teaching independence** — the branch could anchor a 30-minute talk on its own.

If only 1–2 atoms fit a candidate topic, use tags instead.

### When to merge or remove

- **Hollow** — branch holds <3 atoms with no growth trajectory.
- **Overlap** — >50% of atoms also tagged with another branch → merge or redefine.
- **Subset** — branch A's content is essentially a subset of branch B → merge.

### When to split

- **Bloat** — single branch exceeds 30 atoms and content naturally clusters.
- **Use-case need** — preparing an output (talk, article, course) reveals the branch needs to split.

### One atom, one branch

If an atom spans two branches, pick the one matching the core claim. Use `tags` for the secondary topic.

### Operations checklist

When adding/merging/splitting:
1. Move affected atoms (update their frontmatter `id` to the new branch; this counts as a substantive change so bump `version`).
2. Move the corresponding wiki pages into the new branch subfolder and update any `[[ ]]` links that referenced them.
3. Confirm no orphan tags or broken `[[ ]]` references remain.
4. Use the commit message to explain the rationale — `git log` is your branch-design history.

---

## Operations

The five operations are skills provided by the **atomic-wiki** plugin, invoked as `/atomic-wiki:<name>`. Use `/atomic-wiki:init` to scaffold a new project. Each skill spells out the constraints and the script it runs:

| Skill | Trigger | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `/atomic-wiki:ingest` | new material in `raw/` | classify segments, extract atoms into the matching branch |
| `/atomic-wiki:factcheck` | user-written or freshly extracted atoms, before commit | verify claims against sources, attach found references, propose corrections |
| `/atomic-wiki:compile` | new or changed atoms | group atoms into a wiki page (typical = 3–8 atoms per page) |
| `/atomic-wiki:lint` | periodic or pre-commit | programmatic check + LLM semantic check |
| `/atomic-wiki:query` | answering a question | read `index.md`, load relevant pages, answer |

Read the corresponding skill's `SKILL.md` in the plugin when running each.

---

## After every change

The **atomic-wiki** plugin ships two hooks that handle this automatically:
- `PostToolUse` on Write/Edit of `wiki/**/*.md` runs `gen-index.sh`.
- `Stop` at end of turn runs `lint.sh`.

If you're driving the repo without Claude Code, run them yourself:

```bash
bash "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/gen-index.sh"   # rebuild index
bash "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/lint.sh"         # programmatic Lint
```

Commit your changes. The pre-commit hook (installed by `/atomic-wiki:init`; re-run init after a fresh clone to restore it) checks atom version bumps automatically; your commit message is the change log.

```bash
git add atoms/<branch>/<file>.md wiki/<branch>/<page>.md
git commit -m "describe the change"
```

`index.md` and `lint-report.md` are auto-generated and stay gitignored — don't commit them.

If `lint.sh` reports errors (not just warnings), fix them before committing.

---

## Source attribution patterns

Three options for `source_ids`:

```yaml
# URL-based (public content)
source_ids: ["https://example.com/post/12345"]

# Video sources — deep-link the moment when the source is timestamped
source_ids: ["https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abc123&t=252"]

# File-based (private materials)
source_ids: ["lectures/skill-design.md"]

# Hash-based (when source stability matters)
source_ids: ["sha256:abc123..."]
```

Use hash IDs when you need to detect that a source was modified after extraction.

---

## What you must not do

- **Edit an atom's body without bumping `version:`.** The pre-commit hook will reject the commit. If the only change is whitespace/formatting, the hook lets it through unchanged.
- **Create a new atom for an evolved view.** Edit the existing atom and bump the version. Git keeps the prior text. Don't reintroduce `_archive/` or `superseded_by`.
- **Write a second atom for a claim an existing atom already makes.** Append the new source to that atom's `source_ids` instead — cross-source confirmation is the point.
- **Add `created:` or `updated:` to frontmatter.** Git and Obsidian Dataview both have these — frontmatter dates drift.
- **Date-prefix atom filenames.** Same reason. `slug.md`, not `YYYY-MM-DD-slug.md`.
- **Write to `raw/`.** It is read-only from your perspective. (Linking to `raw/` files from atoms and wiki pages is fine — that is how images are used.)
- **Copy images out of `raw/`.** Atoms and wiki pages embed them by reference (`../../raw/...`); the file has one committed home.
- **Invent branches without user approval.** Branch design has independence/scale/boundary criteria.
- **Prefix wiki slugs with the branch name.** The branch is the folder; the slug is what's inside it. `wiki/mcp/auth.md`, not `wiki/mcp/mcp-auth.md`.
- **Use bold/italic to compensate for unclear writing.** If a sentence needs emphasis to be understood, rewrite the sentence.
- **Patch wiki pages to hide atom-layer problems.** If the wiki is wrong because an atom is wrong, fix the atom.
- **Compile in parallel without a slug lock.** You will produce naming collisions.
- **Treat the wiki as source of truth.** It is a derived cache. The atoms are truth.
- **Delete atoms or wiki pages without committing the deletion.** Git history is your only safety net now.

---

## Customizing for your domain

- **Add `source_type` values** for your sources (e.g. `email`, `slack`, `obsidian`).
- **Add `type` values** if your knowledge has categories beyond the seven defaults.
- **Adjust temporal regex** in `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/lint.sh` to match your conventions.
- **Tune length thresholds** if your wiki style is denser or looser than 1500–2500 words.

Document any deviation — rules and scripts are coupled, divergence without documentation will confuse future contributors (including future-you).

## When in doubt

Defer to the user. This repo represents their knowledge, organized to their standards. Your job is to operate the pipeline reliably, not to make judgment calls about what their knowledge should look like. If something feels ambiguous, surface it instead of guessing.
